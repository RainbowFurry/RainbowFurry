## 💻Coding and IT

I have successfully completed an apprenticeship as a software developer. Even during my training, I was bored after work and thirsty to do new things in IT. I created and managed many game servers and application servers and programmed many exciting projects.
After that I started as a full stack developer to improve myself in this area as well. 

Unfortunately, I don't have any projects on GitHub as they are all in Azure.
